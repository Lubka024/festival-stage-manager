# The purpose of your application I need an app to manage stages on a festival event. I want to be able to create stages, concerts on them and also track needed equipment for each stage and concert. I would also like to be able to save a files for lights and sound panels setup. 

# Scope of your application
With Contember, I can help you build the following parts of your festival event management application:

1. Create and manage stages, including their names and locations.
2. Add and manage concerts on each stage, including details like artist names, performance times, and descriptions.
3. Track and manage equipment needed for each stage and concert, such as microphones, speakers, and lighting.
4. Store and manage files for lights and sound panel setups, allowing you to upload and download them as needed.
## What can Contember not do for my project?
Contember may not be able to provide the following for your festival event management project:

1. Customized event ticketing and payment processing, as it would require integration with third-party services.
2. Real-time communication or chat features for staff and attendees, as Contember focuses on content management and not real-time interactions.
3. Mobile app development for attendees, as Contember is primarily a web-based platform for content management.
4. Advanced analytics and reporting, as Contember does not have built-in analytics tools. You may need to integrate with external tools or services for this purpose.
